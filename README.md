Ekstrem multiprogrammering
==========================

This was code for a course about multiprogramming that I followed in 2007.
The main focus is on an implementation of pawn chess in the occam language
implementation of CSP using the [Kent Retargetable occam Compiler](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/kroc/)

Enjoy!
